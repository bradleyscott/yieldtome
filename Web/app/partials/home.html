    <h2>Frequently asked</h2>
    <accordion>
        <accordion-group heading="Do all an event's delegates need to sign in to yieldto.me?">
          No. The event organiser can manually add delegates who aren't using yieldto.me. They can then add them as Speakers on Speakers lists and cast Votes on their behalf- just as you would have done without yieldto.me
        </accordion-group>
        <accordion-group heading="Can I use yieldto.me without a Facebook account?">
          So you don't need to remember yet another username and password we are taking advantage of Facebook's login capabilities. yieldto.me won't have the ability to post on your wall or anything like that. We will just record your Facebook user ID and email address so we can make sure we remember you. 
          Unfortunately, if you don't have Facebook- you can't use yieldto.me at this stage. But, you can vote to support other login mechanisms on our <a href="https://yieldtome.uservoice.com"  target="_blank">feature request site</a>
        </accordion-group>
        <accordion-group heading="What features will you add next?">
          That is partly up to you. We have lots of ideas and you can influence the priority by voting on our <a href="https://yieldtome.uservoice.com"  target="_blank">feature request site</a>. Some of the ideas on the list are:
          <ul>
            <li>Delegate to delegate instant messaging</li>
            <li>Add delegates to an Event in bulk. A time saver for event organisers</li>
            <li>Keyboard shortcuts - for power users with a keyboard</li>
            <li>iPhone and Android Apps</li>
            <li>Help overlays to assist first time users</li>
          </ul>
        </accordion-group>
        <accordion-group heading="How can I contribute code?">
          yieldto.me is open source- meaning you can see the code and contribute to fixing bugs and developing enhancements or new features. The code is <a href="http://www.github.com/bradleyscott/yieldtome" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> for you to look at, fork, and submit pull requests to. We also have an RESTful API that can be used to develop your own stand-alone Apps and sites using yieldto.me's data. Get in contact if you want an API key.
